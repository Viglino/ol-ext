## CeCILL-B FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT :

This Agreement is an open source software license intended to give users
significant freedom to modify and redistribute the software licensed

The exercising of this freedom is conditional upon a strong obligation

In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
